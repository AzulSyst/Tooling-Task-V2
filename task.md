Task:

Prepare a CLI tool to create a detailed report of running processes on a Windows laptop.
This tool assesses your practical skills in developing portable, secure, and user-friendly
utilities.

Your CLI tool must:

### 1. Generate a Comprehensive Report:
-----------------------------------

a. List running processes, including details such as process ID (PID), name,
user, CPU usage, and memory usage.

b. Output the report in an easily visualizable format (CSV or JSON).

### 2. Visualization:
-----------------

#### a. Document how the generated report can be visualized using readily
accessible tools (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, or open-source visualization
software).

#### b. Include a sample visualization demonstrating metrics such as total
running processes per user.

### 3. Portability and Ease of Use:
-------------------------------

a. Ensure the CLI tool can be executed from any directory (e.g., Downloads,
Documents).

b. Avoid external dependencies or provide clear, justified reasons if you
choose to include any.

### 4. Documentation and CI Integration:
------------------------------------

a. Include a clear README file in your repository detailing installation,
execution, example usage, and troubleshooting tips.

b. Implement a simple Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (using GitHub
Actions, GitLab CI, or similar) that automatically checks the tool's basic
functionality upon code changes.

Bonus Points:
-------------
• Provide automated tests for your CLI tool.
• Create an Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) deployment (Ansible, etc.).
• Develop a MacOS-compatible version of the tool.

Evaluation Criteria:
--------------------
• Functionality and accuracy of the report.
• Code quality, readability, maintainability.
• Clarity and completeness of documentation.
• Effectiveness and simplicity of the CI pipeline.
• Additional enhancements demonstrating creativity and technical excellence.

Note: 
Host your solution in a publicly accessible repository (GitHub, GitLab) and
provide clear instructions for accessing and evaluating your submission
